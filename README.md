# Conditions and Iterations in Python

## SWABT:

* Demonstrate the applications of for-loops and while loops, and understand when to use one vs the other. 
* Iterate over data contained in lists and dictionaries. 
* Apply nested loops (loops within loops) to deal with mulitple
* Write small programs that use control flow/conditional logic
* Demonstrate a clear understanding of decomposing conditional statements down to a single boolean. 
* Make use of map and filter when appropriate
